# FMR-covariates-clustering

This project provide the R codes for the paper 'Analyzing covariate clustering effects in healthcare cost subgroups: insights and applications for prediction'. This paper can be downloaded at https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05793.

 - ``innerLayer-AMDD.r`` is the ADMM algorithm for the inner iteration.

 - ``outerLayer-EM.r`` is the EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters.

 - ``simulation-example.r`` shows the simulated examples in the section 4.
