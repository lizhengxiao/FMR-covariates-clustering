# FMR-covariates-clustering

This project provide the R codes for the paper 'Analyzing covariate clustering effects in healthcare cost subgroups: insights and applications for prediction'.

 - ``innerLayer-AMDD.r`` is the ADMM algorithm for the inner iteration.

 - ``outerLayer-EM`` is the EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters.

 - ``simulation-example`` shows the simulated examples in the section 4.
